If you find that Moar\r\ndoesn't work that way,\r\n[please report it](https://github.com/walles/moar/issues)!\r\n\r\nReasons to use Moar over Less are:\r\n* Moar syntax highlights source code files by default\r\n* Moar does incremental find-as-you-type search\r\n* Moar shows you your position in the file by default\r\n\r\n# Instructions\r\nInstructions for installing, running and developing are all in the [README.md](https://github.com/walles/moar).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
